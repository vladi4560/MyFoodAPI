# Food App with Custom API using Google Sheets

This project is a food app that utilizes a custom API built using Google Sheets. The main goal of the app is to create My Own API and  provide users with personalized diet plans based on their BMI (Body Mass Index) and food calorie information. 

The app offers functionality to calculate the user's BMI, track food calories, and generate a suitable diet plan tailored to their individual needs. By leveraging Google Sheets as the backend, the API allows for easy data management and updates.
